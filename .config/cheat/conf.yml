  # While it requires no configuration here, it's also worth noting that
  # 'cheat' will automatically append directories named '.cheat' within the
  # current working directory to the 'cheatpath'. This can be very useful if
  # you'd like to closely associate cheatsheets with, for example, a directory
  # containing source code.
  #
  # Such "directory-scoped" cheatsheets will be treated as the most "local"
  # cheatsheets, and will override less "local" cheatsheets. Likewise,
  # directory-scoped cheatsheets will always be editable ('readonly: false').
